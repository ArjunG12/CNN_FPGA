# CNN_FPGA
Implementation of simple CNN architecture on FPGA

## Padding layer

Inputs- clk, rst, count_i, count_j, pad_x, pad_y,
outputs- addr, c
Description- We input the x and y coordinates of an image in count_i and count_j and the padding values. In return we get the pixel value at that point and 2 points below it per clock cycle.

## Buffer_pad_to_conv- Acts as a buffer from the padding layer to  the convolution layer. Outputs 3-pixel values simultaneously.
